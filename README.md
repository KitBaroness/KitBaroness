## About
<p>
Throughout my career, Iâ€™ve had the opportunity to wear many hats in different industries and explore a variety of roles. One lesson that has been invaluable to me is understanding the basics of any given subject before diving into complex topics. Having this knowledge as a foundation allows for more efficient problem solving and greater accuracy when handling challenges within any field or industry.
</p>
<p>
The importance of having an understanding of fundamentals cannot be overstated; it sets us up for success by providing us with tools we can use to tackle difficult problems without getting lost in noise or complexity along the way. It also helps create clarity by allowing us to see how seemingly unrelated concepts are actually connected at their core levelâ€”helping provide insight on how best to approach our work from multiple angles simultaneously if needed.
</p>
<p>
In addition, focusing on basics provides many opportunities for creative problem-solving since there is often more than one right answerâ€”depending on what specific needs must be met and which resources are available at hand. By having an appreciation for foundational principles across various disciplines, you will find yourself better equipped with both technical skillsets as well as innovative thinking capabilities necessary in today's business world.
</p>

But always have fun!
